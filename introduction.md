# Discord Bots with Python Tutorial

## Introduction
This tutorial is created by Exenifix and is supposed to provide a publicly available guide to creating Discord bots with usage of popular Discord API wrappers. The tutorial will be **continuously maintained** as new versions of libraries are released. It is also planned to bring the tutorial onto the site. **All code samples in the tutorial are written using the best known techniques**, although if you find any better solutions to some problems being resolved in a code, we are always opened for suggestions.

## License
This tutorial and all code samples included are licensed under the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International** which can be found in `LICENSE` file of this gist.

## Target Audience
This tutorial is designed for people of any age and gender who are willing to make a Discord bot with Python.

## Knowledge Required
We recommend to know the following basis to successfully figure out features the tutorials teaches about:
- basic Python syntax
- for and while loops
- functional programming
- object-oriented programming (including classes and objects concept, inheritance)
- modules
- basic asynchronous programming principles

> Even if you don't know some of the terms listed above, feel free to start the tutorial anyway - you will be able to learn them on your way. Although, if you **aren't familiar with most of this, we recommend learning Python first and coming back to this tutorial later**, because there's a high chance of you starting just to copypaste code and understanding nothing. Our goal is to provide *knowledge* first of all, and the code is only a tool for that.

## Software Requirements
- [Python Interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.8
- Development Environment (we can suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). We highly **do not** recommend Replit specifically for Discord bots development due to some reasons)

## Learning Route
1. Libraries Installation and Encironment Setup
2. Basic Bot
3. Commands
4. Events Listening
5. Errors Handling
6. Cogs
7. Bot Subclassing
8. Database Integration
