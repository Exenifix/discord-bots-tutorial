# Discord Bots with Python Tutorial

## Introduction
This tutorial is created by Exenifix and is supposed to provide a publicly available guide to creating Discord bots with usage of popular Discord API wrappers. The tutorial will be **continuously maintained** as new versions of libraries are released. It is also planned to bring the tutorial onto the site. **All code samples in the tutorial are written using the best known techniques**, although if you find any better solutions to some problems being resolved in a code, we are always opened for suggestions.

## License
This tutorial and all code samples included are licensed under the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International** which can be found in `LICENSE` file of this gist.

## Target Audience
This tutorial is designed for people of any age and gender who are willing to make a Discord bot with Python.

## Knowledge Required
We recommend to know the following basis to successfully figure out features the tutorials teaches about:
- basic Python syntax
- for and while loops
- functional programming
- object-oriented programming (including classes and objects concept, inheritance)
- modules
- basic asynchronous programming principles

> Even if you don't know some of the terms listed above, feel free to start the tutorial anyway - you will be able to learn them on your way. Although, if you **aren't familiar with most of this, we recommend learning Python first and coming back to this tutorial later**, because there's a high chance of you starting just to copypaste code and understanding nothing. Our goal is to provide *knowledge* first of all, and the code is only a tool for that.

## Software Requirements
- [Python Interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.8
- Development Environment (we can suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). We highly **do not** recommend Replit specifically for Discord bots development due to some reasons)

1. Libraries Installation and Environment Setup
2. Basic Bot
3. Commands
4. Converters
5. Events Listening
6. Errors Handling
7. Cogs
8. Database Integration
