# Lesson 1 | Basic Bot
## Lesson Subject
Learn how to create application on Discord Developer portal and build a very basic bot.

## Creating Application
1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Go to application page and select `Bot` tab
4. Click `Add Bot` button
5. Notice the `Reset Token` button - you may press it and copy the token right now or come back to it later
6. Invite the bot to your server from `OAuth2` -> `URL Generator`. Add `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes and required permissions, then copy link and follow it

## Token Storage
### .env file
Usually the developers use `.env` config files to store the token securely. We are going to show you how to use them in code.
1. Run this command to install the module for working with `.env` files
```sh
$ pip install python-dotenv
```
2. Create a new file named `.env` with the following contents:
```
TOKEN=
```
3. Put your token **without any additional symbols or spaces** right after `TOKEN=`. It should look like this:
```
TOKEN=OTc5MzU0NTM0NTEyMDUwMTk2.G9Ft4q.kcb5BIKqqJnDtwviIz_VMiaunVLLci8U6Oxlgc
```
4. Now in your main script you can get it like this:
```py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv


load_dotenv()
TOKEN = os.getenv("TOKEN")
assert TOKEN is not None, "TOKEN was not found"  # we need this to make sure that token is filled in correctly.
```

### Fernet Encryption
You may also *encrypt* your token so it is visible only if you have the key to decrypt it. We will need `cryptography` module to done this:
```sh
$ pip install cryptography
```
#### Encryption Script
```py
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

key = Fernet.generate_key()
fernet = Fernet(key)
with open("key.key", "wb") as key_file, open("token", "wb") as token_file:
    key_file.write(key)
    token = input("Insert the token here: ").encode()
    token_file.write(fernet.encrypt(token))
```
#### Decryption Script
```py
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

with open("key.key", "rb") as key_file, open("token", "rb") as token_file:
    fernet = Fernet(key_file.read())
    TOKEN = fernet.decrypt(token_file.read()).decode()
```
In your `token` file the encrypted token is stored, and in the `key.key` the key required to decrypt the token is stored. You may put the key into some safe place and use it when needed.

## Basic Bot
Now let's build a bot! 
> To display logs in this sample we are going to use `exencolorlogs` module which can be installed with pip. You may use simple `print()` statements or setup logging by yourself if you don't like this module's implementation.
```py
import os
import sys

import disnake
from disnake.ext import commands
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from exencolorlogs import Logger


def get_token() -> str:
    """Fill in this function based on the method you used for storing token. This one uses .env file."""
    load_dotenv()
    token = os.getenv("TOKEN")
    if token is None:
        log.critical("Token is not filled in.")
        sys.exit(1)

    return token


bot = commands.Bot( command_prefix="!")  # create a bot object, it is the object everything will be based on
log = Logger()


@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    log.ok("Bot is ready!")


log.info("Starting the bot...")
bot.run(get_token())
```

If everything went fine, you will receive "Bot is ready!" message in the console and your bot will come online! You may also change its activity by adding this into `on_ready`:
```py
await bot.change_presence(activity=disnake.Game("python"))
```

## Asynchronous App
The bot we just made is *an asynchronous app* which uses `async` and `await` keywords. All API calls must be awaited. It is recommended to know principles of asynchronous programming for this tutorial although it is a good entrypoint to asynchronous programming overall.
